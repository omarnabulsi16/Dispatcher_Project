# Dispatcher Summer Project

I will be creating a website for Dispatchers to display crew information connected through a database as well as added functionality to display which crews are on duty while keeping records of crews on leave.

The left column is a list people who are currently on duty, while the right column is a list of people who are on vacation/leave.
